<summary>How to get credentials?</summary>

A service account is a special type of Google account intended to represent a non-human user that needs to authenticate
and be authorized to access data in Google APIs.

Since it‚Äôs a separate account, by default it does not have access to any spreadsheet until you share it with this
account. Just like any other Google account.

#### Here‚Äôs how to get one:

1. Enable API Access for a Project if you haven‚Äôt done it yet.

    <summary>ü§î How do I enable API Access?</summary>
    Enable API Access for a ProjectÔÉÅ
    Head to Google Developers Console and create a new project (or select the one you already have).

   In the box labeled ‚ÄúSearch for APIs and Services‚Äù, search for ‚ÄúGoogle Drive API‚Äù and enable it.

   In the box labeled ‚ÄúSearch for APIs and Services‚Äù, search for ‚ÄúGoogle Sheets API‚Äù and enable it.
    </details>
2. Go to ‚ÄúAPIs & Services > Credentials‚Äù and choose ‚ÄúCreate credentials > Service account key‚Äù.
3. Fill out the form
4. Click ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù and ‚ÄúDone‚Äù.
5. Press ‚ÄúManage service accounts‚Äù above Service Accounts.
6. Press on ‚ãÆ near recently created service account and select ‚ÄúManage keys‚Äù and then click on ‚ÄúADD KEY > Create new
   key‚Äù.
7. Select JSON key type and press ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù.

You will automatically download a JSON file with credentials. It may look like this:

```json
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "api-project-XXX",
  "private_key_id": "2cd ‚Ä¶ ba4",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nNrDyLw ‚Ä¶ jINQh/9\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "473000000000-yoursisdifferent@developer.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "473 ‚Ä¶ hd.apps.googleusercontent.com"
}
```

Remember the path to the downloaded credentials file. Also, in the next step you‚Äôll need the value of client_email from
this file.

Very important! Go to your spreadsheet and share it with a client_email from the step above. Just like you do with any
other Google account.

If you don‚Äôt do this, you‚Äôll get a `gspread.exceptions.SpreadsheetNotFound` exception when trying to
access this spreadsheet from your application or a script.

```
